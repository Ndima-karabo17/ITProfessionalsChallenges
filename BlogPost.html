        <h2 class="msg"><strong>How does each OS organize files and folders?</strong></h2>
        <p>An operating sytem is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware.<br>
    It performs all the basics tasks like file management,<br> memory management, process management, handling input, output
    and controlling <br>peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.

         <section>How does each OS organize files and folders?</section>
       <p>
        1. Windows
    - It orgainizes files and folders in a hierarchical e.g C:/ndima mhangwani/Desktop
<br>
2. MacOS 
-It orginizes files and folders using Finder, its native file management system.
<br>
3.LINUX
- It follows a hierarchical file system more like windows but in linux we use commands this means it orginizes files and directories in a tree-like structure.

       <div class="path">
       <section> How are files paths written?</section>

<p>
    1.Linux- it is as string that specifies the location of a file and directory e.g C:\Users\ndima mhangwani
<br>
2.Windows- it is using same as linux and using backslashes to separate between directories e.g C:\Users\ndima mhangwani\Documents\Mlab
<br>
3.MacOS - it uses forward slashes to separate directory levels e.g C:/Users/ndima mhangwani/Documents/Mlab

</p>
       </div>
       <div class="naming">
        <section>Are there naming restriction?</section>
        <p>Yes, for windows name cannot be more than 260 characters and special characters like * is not allowed when creatin a file.
For Linux and MacOS the rules are the same for restriction you can have most characters as long you don't include a forward slash(/) and the null character.
</p>
       </div>
<div class="fileUsed">
        <section>What file systems are used?</section>
        <p>In windows we use NTFS as its main file system, MacOS uses Apple File System for newer version but for old is HFS+ and Linux utilizes a variety of file systems with ext4 which is most common
along with XFS, JFS.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="mention">
        <section>Mention FAT specifically, where is it still used?</section>
        <p>Although Windows 10 and 11 still support FAT, they use NTFS by default, and Reefs to a lesser extent.
Although the FAT system has been superseded on most Windows computers,
current Windows editions still support FAT, as do macOS, Linux and Unix. In
addition, FAT is still used for floppy disks, USB flash drives and storage media in
smaller, portable devices such as digital cameras.
